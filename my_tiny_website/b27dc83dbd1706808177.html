Kelsey also led public demonstrations for museum visitors using a projection of insect samples under a microscope.</p><p></p><p>Kelsey's educational background includes completing the All Women UX/UI Design Bootcamp, where she focused on design thinking, human-centered design, wireframing, and prototyping. Her final project was selected to be featured on AllWomen's online archives.
